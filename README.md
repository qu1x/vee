The goal of this crate is to generate optimized code for geometric algebra flavors. Currently, this
crate implements the symbolic reduction of multivector expressions up to polynomials with rational
coefficients.

## Features

  * Uniquely reduce symbolic multivector expressions.
  * Generate expressions in text form.
  * Define the metric-agnostic basis (i.e., elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic) and the multivector
    entities of the projective geometric algebra (PGA) for dimensions D = N + 1 < 8.

## Roadmap

  * Eliminate orthonormalization conditions form expressions using reflection/projection operator by
    factoring pinned symbols and GCD coefficients in symbolic storage rather than during formatting.
  * Generate expressions in code form.
  * Define other geometric algebra flavors.

See the [release history](RELEASES.md) to keep track of the development.

## Pseudo-local Documentation Builds

Build the documentation with [cargo-tex](cargo-tex). Note that navigating the documentation requires
web access as KaTeX is embedded via remote CDN.
